    <h3>Help Your Neighbors</h3>
    <p>Many times, neighbors want to simply help neighbors.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>My name is Russ Fustino, co-founder of “Take a Swing at Cancer” in New England non-profit and a Microsoft MVP. I am in the process of starting a new non-profit called &#39;Help Your Neighbors&#39;. If you wish to help in this effort, please contact me at <a href="mailto:russ@fustinobrothers.com">russ@fustinobrothers.com</a> 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>For the first fundraiser, this organization will help a neighbor of mine... David Wagner</p>
    <p>I am a neighbor and friend to David Wagner who is 44 years old and a 20+ year resident of Gulf Harbors Condominiums in New Port Richey, FL. David is intellectually disabled and has a brain tumor, which is currently in remission. 

    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>He also recently suffered a stroke and is half paralyzed on his left side of the body. He lives on the 2nd floor with his mom, JoAnn Wagner. There are costs associated with accessibility to his condo and these funds will go directly to David’s family to use as appropriate. One big item is a chair lift. We need the funds by June 1, 2016.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
I met David on the first day I moved to Florida in 2003 from New England. He volunteered to help me unload the U-Haul and move me in.  Ever since, he has helped me do odd jobs and errands as he has done for many folks in the neighborhood.  He is my friend, as he is to many in the community.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
I recently assisted David, once, up the stairs, butt cheek by butt cheek, sitting on each stair and lifting himself with his good leg. That's all it took for me to say to myself, "I need to do something here to help David". He recently needed an ambulance, and the first words out of the EMT was "How do you get him up and down stairs?". His mother said, "On a good day, one step at a time on his butt. On a bad day, we can’t “. Fortunately, David recovered from that emergency and his spirits are high.  Recently, he even walked up the stairs, with the assistance of two adults, for the first time in a year in a half.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
The Wagner’s are not in a position to move to a lower level unit. They have lived in their current condo for over 20 years. In addition to David and his mom JoAnn, many residents in Gulf Harbor Condominiums community, his relatives and friends would be thankful for your contributions to make his life better, meeting a basic accessibility need of getting to and from his home. Monies will be used to purchase, install and maintain a chair lift.
